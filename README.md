# Cloudflare Zero Trust List Manager

**üå©Ô∏è** Keep your Cloudflare Zero Trust domain lists up to date automatically

## Description

Cloudflare Zero Trust List Manager is a project that dynamically updates the Cloudflare Trust domain lists. The project can obtain domain lists from a variety of sources, including domain list URLs and hostfiles.

The use for which this program was created was to keep the lists updated with domain and host lists used in solutions like [AdGuard](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) and [Pihole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole) to block ads and telemetry on any device connected with Cloudflare Zero Trust, but it can also be used for any other purpose that needs to update cloudflare lists from host files or domain lists hosted on the internet.

## Usage

* `API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API key
* `IDENTIFIER`: Your Cloudflare account ID

### Configuration
